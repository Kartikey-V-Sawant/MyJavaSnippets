1. Polymorphism.
Ans In this we  can perform a single action in different ways.
    Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs.
    The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

2. Runtime Polymorphism.
Ans It is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.
    In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass.
    The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.
    for eg If the reference variable of Parent class refers to the object of Child class.

3. Compile Time Polymorphism.
Ans It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.
    for eg '+' operator can be used for addition and for concatenating string values.

4. Inheritance.
Ans It is mechanism in which  a class is allowed to inherit its properties to another class.The class which inherites its property is parent class and the class
    which is derived from parent class is called child class.

1.  Write a program to validate whether the given json file is a valid JSON file or not.
    Program must accept the name of the json via a config/properties file.
    It must use exceptions. It need not print the output of the JSON file but it needs to
    tell us about the validity of the JSON file.

1. What is try catch block? what is it used for?
Ans:    Java try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. It must be used within the method.
        If an exception occurs at the particular statement of try block, the rest of the block code will not execute.
        So, it is recommended not to keeping the code in try block that will not throw an exception.
        Java try block must be followed by either catch or finally block.

        Question:
        a)  What will happen if we don't catch the exception? Is it something which we could afford? What impact does it have on the program?
        Ans When you try something, you may win or loose, pass or fail.
        That is the try block.If you don’t want to loose or fail, then use the ‘Catch’ block.
        It will tell you the mistake(Exception), so that you don’t repeat the mistake.

1. What is JSON ??
It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

    a)  What is a JSON structure?
    JSON is Collections of hashmap.
    JSON defines only two data structures: objects and arrays.
    It has two data structures: collection & list.
    An object is a set of name-value pairs, and an array is a list of values.
    JSON defines seven value types: string, number, object, array, true, false, and null.
    1.Objects are enclosed in braces ({}), their name-value pairs are separated by a comma (,), and the name and value in a pair are separated by a colon (:).
    2.Arrays are enclosed in brackets ([]), and their values are separated by a comma (,). Each value in an array may be of a different type, including another array or an object.
    3.When objects and arrays contain other objects or arrays, the data has a tree-like structure.

1. what is the purpose of hashmap?
Ans:The purpose of a map is to store items based on a key that can be used to retrieve the item at a later point.
    Similar functionality can only be achieved with a list in the limited case where the key happens to be the position in the list.
    1.It is used for representing data from json file.
    2.In hashmap it is easy to store and retrieve an element.
    3.It can be used in an Java Spinner ,Dropdown list,etc.
    4.It can be used for security purpose e.g. Securing passwords in any data.

a) Question:    Why is the hashmap faster than the List/Array ??
Ans In List/Array if we want to search an element the time varies in while performing the search operation.It depends upon the number of elements in list/array.
    Whereas in hashmap it takes same time for searching element. As it searches on basis of key & value.


2. How does hashmap work?
Ans HashMap in Java works on hashing principle. It is a data structure which allows us to store object and retrieve it in constant time O(1) provided we know the key.
    In hashing, hash functions are used to link key and value in HashMap. Objects are stored by calling put(key, value) method of HashMap and retrieved by calling get(key) method.
    When we call put method, hashcode() method of the key object is called so that hash function of the map can find a bucket location to store value object,
    which is actually an index of the internal array, known as the table.
    HashMap internally stores mapping in the form of Map.Entry object which contains both key and value object.
    When you want to retrieve the object, you call the get() method and again pass the key object.
    This time again key object generate same hash code (it's mandatory for it to do so to retrieve the object and that's why HashMap keys are immutable e.g. String)
    and we end up at same bucket location.
    If there is only one object then it is returned and that's your value object which you have stored earlier



3. Why would we use hashmap ????????
Ans. 1.Hashmap is fast in storing and retrieving elements as comapared to any other data structure.
     2.It has constant time performance for it's operation.
     2.HashMap contains values based on the key.
     3.Contains only unique elements.
     4.May have one null key and multiple null values
     5.Maintains no order for storing elements.
